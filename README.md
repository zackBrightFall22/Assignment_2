Assignment 2

This code meets all the requirements of Assignment 2.
It is straightforward as there is no user input.
For Problem (1) I created a Singly Linked List of names and tested all the functions. I created outputes in a simple but clean manner so that when you are looking at the code you can see which output corresponds to which function.

For Problem (2) I created an abstract Employee base class and two derived classes, Professional and Nonprofessional that implement the purely virtual functions. I then created some outputs that show that all the functions work as desired.
